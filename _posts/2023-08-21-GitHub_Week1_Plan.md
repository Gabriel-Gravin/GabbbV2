# Monday

- Downloaded VSCode. I cloned the teacher repositroy by using the git clone commands. I learned how to cd into different places using the wsl.

# Tuesday

- I created my own repository in github by cloning into the teacher repository. I also established my connection to github with the git config commands.

# Wednesday

- Installed ruby, python, and jupyter using the commands in the proceders. I also installed all the gems.

# Thursday

- Had trouble getting my server to run with the make command in VSCode.

# Friday

- Got my server running with the make command and changed the theme of the website. I put in the picture I drew the week before. And I made a class list and put it on my home page.
