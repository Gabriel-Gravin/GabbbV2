# Showbiz!

I was delighted to see people actively engaging with our leaderboard. They eagerly attempted to complete the game swiftly, eagerly checking their names on the board afterward. I often heard exclamations of "There I am!" or "Hey, I'm in __ place!" Our leaderboard accumulated a significant amount of data by the conclusion of N@TM.

# Success!

I was ecstatic to get the multiplayer leaderboard in as it gave people a greater purpose to beat other people then just themselves.

I did a great job explaning to people how we worked on our leaderboard by using fancy words like "github," "industry grade tools," and "22 person development team."

# Improvments!

We needed to show how to imput your name. We didn't show this to people enough so we had lots of "guests" on the leaderboard.

# Other projects

It was really fun to look at the cermaic room. There were lots of cool creations there.
